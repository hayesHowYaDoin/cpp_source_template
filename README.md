# Header-Only Library Template

This repository hosts a template to be used as a starting point for creating 
header-only libraries in C++. The overall project layout is inspired by the 
Boost project (https://github.com/boostorg/boost), and uses a Docker Dev 
Container with VSCode.

## Prerequisites

The following instructions assume that Docker, VSCode and Git are installed on 
the host computer. The VSCode extension Remote Development 
(ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) is required to open the project 
in a Dev Container. 

## Setting Up The Development Environment

1) Clone the repository onto the host computer with the following command:
   ```
    git clone https://github.com/hayesHowYaDoin/header_template.git
   ```
2) Open the folder in VSCode. In the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), execute 
the command "Dev Containers: Open Folder In Container..."

And... that's it!
